DbDialog is an open source, accessible database manager.  It achieves a high level of both functionality and accessibility by exploiting capabilities of standard Windows controls and the ActiveX Data Objects API.  It supports tables of records in various formats, including Microsoft Access, MySQL, and dBase.  Once a table is defined, records may be created, modified, browsed, searched, and output in an efficient manner.
Full documentation is in the file DbDialog.htm.
