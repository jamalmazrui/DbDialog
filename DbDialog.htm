  Description<br>
  DbDialog is an open source, accessible database manager. It achieves
  a high level of both functionality and accessibility by exploiting
  capabilities of standard Windows controls and the ActiveX Data
  Objects API. It supports tables of records in various formats,
  including Microsoft Access, MySQL, and dBase. Once a table is
  defined, records may be created, modified, browsed, searched, and
  output in an efficient manner.<br>
  ----------<br>
  Installation<br>
  The installation program for DbDialog is called ddsetup.exe. When
  executed, it prompts for an installation folder for the program. The
  default folder is<br>
  C:\Program Files (x86)\DbDialog<br>
  The installation process creates a program group for DbDialog on the
  Windows start menu, containing choices to launch DbDialog, read
  Documentation for DbDialog, read documentation for Layout by Code,
  and uninstall DbDialog. Also created is a desktop shortcut with an
  associated hot key, enabling DbDialog to be launched by pressing
  Control+Alt+D.<br>
  Three Regions<br>
  As its name implies, DbDialog is oriented around a single, main
  dialog for most operations. This dialog is divided into three major
  regions from left to right, corresponding to action buttons, input
  fields, and the record list. At the top of each region is an
  associated heading.<br>
  Action Buttons<br>
  The ACTION heading is in the upper left corner of the dialog. Below
  it is an alphabetized series of about 20 buttons, one under the
  other, until near the bottom of the dialog. The number of buttons may
  seem overwhelming at first, but they are named in a mnemonic manner,
  and may be navigated easily with either the Tab/Shift+Tab or
  Down/UpArrow keys As one learns the buttons, they may be invoked more
  directly and efficiently by pressing Alt plus the initial letter of
  the name, e.g., Alt+C to Create a new record.

  <p>The complete series of buttons is as follows: Action, Beginning,
  Create, Delete, End, Filter, Go To, Help, Index, Jump, List, Modify,
  Next, Output, Previous, Quit, Repeat Jump, Select, Tag, Untag, View,
  /Extra Tools, Zoom In, ;Lookup, and /Run. Note that the first button
  is Action. It serves as both a button and the heading for the region
  of action buttons. When invoked, it moves focus to the start of the
  series of action buttons from other parts of the dialog. Also note
  these minor departures from initial letter invocation of buttons:
  Alt+X for Extra Tools, Alt+; for Lookup, and Alt+/ for Run.<br>
  Input Fields<br>
  The central region of the dialog contains a series of input fields
  corresponding to a single record in the current database table. Each
  field is on a line by itself with an associated label to its left. By
  default, the input fields are in a display mode and the heading for
  the region is VIEW. Depending on the action button invoked, this mode
  may be changed to CREATE, MODIFY, or another that permits you to type
  in the fields.</p>

  <p>DbDialog works with almost any database table, though only certain
  data types may be edited. Upon installation, the Contact table is the
  default. It is intended to capture almost all regularly occuring data
  items that one would store about an individual or organization. The
  many fields have been named such that each has a unique initial
  letter. Just like with the action buttons, this naming technique
  permits each field to be accessed directly by pressing its initial
  letter in combination with the Alt key.</p>

  <p>For the Contact table, the series of input fields is as follows:
  Title, First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, Job, Enterprise, Address1,
  Address2, City, State, Zip, Nation, Office Phone, Home Phone,
  Wireless Phone, Business Email, Personal Email, URL, Date of Birth,
  Gender, and Extra Info. Some minor departures from initial letter
  invocation of fields are as follows: Alt+1 for Address1, Alt+2 for
  Address2, and Alt+X for Extra Info. The latter field is a multi-line
  edit field for storing almost any amount of extra information about a
  contact.<br>
  Record List<br>
  The heading for the region on the right of the dialog is LIST. Below
  it is a list box containing summary information for each record of
  the table. Each record displays the same selection of fields, ones
  that are most likely to identify the record. If the table includes a
  field called Tagged, then it is the left-most field in the list. It
  indicates whether a record is currently tagged by the presence or
  absence of the asterisk (*) character. By default, the record list of
  the Contact table additionally displays the fields Last Name, First
  Name, and Enterprise (enterprise is a synonym for company or
  organization, whose initial letters are already being used by other
  fields).</p>

  <p>The record list is a standard list box that supports navigation by
  Down/UPArrow, PageDown/Up, and End/Home as expected. In addition,
  some action buttons perform similar navigation, such as Alt+B for
  Next, Alt+P for Previous, Alt+E for End, and Alt+B for Beginning.<br>
  Remaining Controls<br>
  Below the input fields near the bottom of the dialog are the pair of
  buttons: OK and Cancel. These are used to confirm or cancel a mode of
  operation such as creating or modifying a record. They may be reached
  via tab navigation, or invoked by pressing Enter for OK or Escape for
  Cancel. In either case, the VIEW mode is activated again, and focus
  is moved to the current record in the list box.</p>

  <p>The status bar spans the width of the dialog along the bottom. It
  displays read-only data about the current record, such as the fields
  ID, Created, and Modified. Good database design recommends that every
  table include an ID field: an automatically generated number that
  uniquely identifies each of its records. If the table includes fields
  called Created and Modified, DbDialog also assigns data to them
  automatically, indicating the original creation date of a record and
  the date it was last modified. Dates in DBDialog are formatted as a
  four digit year, two digit month, and two digit day delimited by a
  dash (-) symbol, e.g., 2006-03-06.<br>
  Create, Modify, View, and Delete<br>
  As mentioned, you can press Alt+A to review the button choices on the
  left side of the main dialog. Navigate among them with Tab/Shift+Tab
  or Down/UpArrow, and then invoke the one desired with Enter or
  Spacebar. Alternatively, press Alt and the button&#39;s invocation
  character, which is generally the initial letter. For example, press
  Alt+C to create a new record, Alt+M to modify an existing record,
  Alt+V to view it, or Alt+D to delete it.<br>
  Jump and Repeat Jump<br>
  Press Alt+J to jump to a particular record based on a string of
  characters in any of its fields, regardless of case. For example,
  respond to the input box by typing &quot;Smith&quot; in order to jump
  to the first record containing this word. If found, focus is placed
  on the matching record in the list box. If the record is not what you
  want, press Alt+J and then Enter to accept the previous jump string
  and move to the next matching record. Alternatively, press Alt+R to
  repeat the jump command.<br>
  Setting a Filter<br>
  Another way of focusing on records with certain text is by setting a
  filter. Pressing Alt+F lets you choose a filter method: Fields,
  Invert, Tagged, Untagged, Refresh, and All. For the Fields choice,
  press F, or just Enter since this button is the default. The heading
  of the input fields region changes to FILTER, and focus is moved to
  the first field--Title in the case of the Contact table. You could
  type a title such as Mr., Ms., or Dr if that is what you want to
  match. You navigate to the fields of interest either with Tab or the
  Alt letter combination that accesses the field directly.</p>

  <p>Press Enter to confirm the input, and then DbDialog will set a
  filter containing only records with matching values. The text may be
  a substring, and it is not case sensitive. So, if you had entered
  &quot;XYZ Corporation&quot; in the Enterprise field and
  &quot;U.S&quot; in the Nation field, the only records appearing in
  the list box would be contacts who work for XYZ Corporation in the
  U.S.</p>

  <p>If you pressed Alt+F again and chose the Invert button instead,
  the filter would show everyone except those at XYZ Corporation in the
  U.S. The Tag or Untagged filter choices show only tagged or untagged
  records, respectively. The Refresh choice refreshes the filter,
  useful in case records were changed by a program other than DbDialog.
  The All choice clears any filter, showing all records in the
  table.<br>
  Setting an Index<br>
  By default, the Contact table shows records in order by Last Name,
  First Name, and Enterprise. Thus, Jane Doe would appear before John
  Doe, and John Doe at UVW Corporation would appear before John Doe at
  XYZ Corporation. You can change the order by setting a different
  index for the table.</p>

  <p>An index is specified with a prioritized sequence of field names.
  By default, the Contact table uses an index criteria so that records
  are alphabetically ordered by Last Name, First Name, and Enterprise.
  Press Alt+I to choose an index method: Fields, Select, Look, Status
  Bar, and None. Press F to enter the mode for specifying a sequence of
  input fields. Navigate to the first priority field and type the
  number 1 in it. Then type 2 in the second priority field, and so on.
  Press Enter to confirm the field sequence, and DbDialog will show
  records in the new order. For example, type 1 in the Nation field, 2
  in the State Field, and 3 in the Last Name field to sort records by
  Nation, State, and Last Name.</p>

  <p>The Select, Look and Status Bar choices sort records according to
  the configuration settings by those names (explained later). The None
  choice clears any index, leaving records in natural physical
  order--usually the order of creation.<br>
  Selecting Fields to Display<br>
  Suppose you want to examine other fields in the list of records.
  Press Alt+S to enter SELECT mode. Similar to INDEX mode, you type
  numpers indicating the sequence of fields to be used. If you type 1
  for Nation, 2 for Zip, 3 for Last Name, and then press Enter,
  DbDialog will show those fields in the record list--preceded by the
  Tagged field.<br>
  Tagging and Untagging<br>
  If you press Alt+T to tag a record in the list, DbDialog places an
  asterisk to its left, and then automatically moves focus to the next
  record. Similarly, Untag makes the Tagged indicator blank, and then
  moves to the next record.<br>
  Generating Output<br>
  Press Alt+O for the following output methods: Fields, List, and
  Count. The Fields choice produces the name and value of every field
  in the current record. The List choice produces select fields of
  every record--similar to the record list. The first line of output
  contains the field names that correspond to the Select command in
  effect. Subsequent lines are in the order corresponding to the Index
  command, and those included correspond to the Filter command.</p>

  <p>The Count choice produces counts for each combination of fields
  selected. For example, if the record list is displaying the State and
  City fields, the output shows the number of contacts in each
  State/City combination. The output is placed in a temporary,
  multi-line edit box, allowing you to examine and revise it before
  saving it to either the clipboard or a file on disk. You can then
  insert the information into another application such as a word
  processor document or email message.<br>
  Going to Another Table<br>
  Press Alt+G to go to another table. DbDialog presents a list of those
  configured. The default installation has four other tables: Event,
  Album, Course, and Enroll. These tables are managed by the user in
  the same ways, and in fact, use the same programming code to do
  so.</p>

  <p>Sample records are provided to illustrate data values, navigation
  capabilities, zoom links, and field actions such as lookup or run.
  For example, a &quot;many-to-many&quot; relationship exists between
  the Contact and Course tables: each student may have multiple
  courses, and each course may have multiple students. The Enroll table
  stores each instance of a student enrollment in a course.</p>

  <p>Although the Contact table was designed with comprehensive
  attention to data requirements, the other tables were designed
  primarily to illustrate management of diffent tables with the same
  user interface. The Events table, for example, is not intended to
  replace a dedicated calendering program.<br>
  Zooming into Another Table<br>
  DbDialog supports relationships between tables. The link between two
  tables is based on a common field. Good database practice recommends
  that this be a unique ID field. For example, the Event table includes
  the Contact_ID field, which holds a value of the ID field in the
  Contact table. a &quot;one-to-many&quot; relationship is said to
  exist between the Contact and Event tables, since each Contact record
  may be linked to multiple Event records.</p>

  <p>Press Alt+Z to pick a zoom link configured for the current table.
  The target table is opened with a filter specification that only
  includes records with the same &quot;key value,&quot; e.g., Event
  records with the same Contact ID as that of the Contact record where
  the Zoom command was issued.</p>

  <p>Press Alt+Q to quit the current zoom level and return to the
  previous one, e.g., to the Contact table with the same current record
  as before. Pressing Alt+Z at the top zoom level quits the
  program.<br>
  Lookup and Run Fields<br>
  To create an Event record for a particular Contact, you need to enter
  the appropriate Contact ID. Since ID numbers are difficult to
  remember, DbDialog provides a mechanism for looking up a value from
  another table. For example, when the Contact ID field has focus,
  press Alt+; for the Lookup command. The semicolon character is used
  instead of a letter so that all letters remain available for direct
  access to fields based on their initial letters. This symbol was
  chosen because of its convenient home-row position on the keyboard,
  and its similarity to the colon character used to indicate a field
  value following a label.</p>

  <p>When a lookup field is configured, pressing Alt+; invokes a mini
  dialog allowing you to pick a value from a list. In the current
  example, the list shows the name of every Contact record. You can
  arrow to the one desired and press Enter. Initial letter navigation
  is also possible. Finally, you can press Alt+J for Jump or Alt+R for
  Repeat Jump to move to an item based on text it contains--similar to
  how these commands work in the main dialog.</p>

  <p>Once an item is picked, its ID number is placed in the Contact ID
  field of the Event record. In addition, the identifying text--the
  name--is placed in the next input field, and focus is moved there. In
  order to show identifying text for ID links, DbDialog uses a
  convention where the table definition includes a field with an _Look
  suffix after one with an _ID suffix, e.g., Contact_Look after
  Contact_ID.</p>

  <p>A run field has a capability different from a lookup field. Press
  Alt+/ to invoke a run command on the current value in the field. This
  works like the Run command on the Windows Start Menu. If the field
  contains a URL, DbDialog launches the default web browser with that
  location. If the field contains an email address, DbDialog launches
  the default email program with a message initiated to that address.
  If the field contains a file name on disk, DbDialog opens it with the
  program associated with that extension, e.g., Microsoft Word for a
  .doc extension. The slash symbol was chosen because of its proximity
  to the other field action key, Alt+; for Lookup, and for its
  association with web addresses that typically include a slash
  character.<br>
  Extra Tools<br>
  Press Alt+X for an additional set of action buttons. The Delete,
  Modify, Tag, and Untag choices are similar to those in the main
  dialog except that they operate on all records in the current filter,
  if any, rather than on the current record only. Use the Remove Table
  choice to completely eliminate a table. The Create button lets you
  create a new record by starting with the values in the current
  record, in case much of its data is similar to what you would
  otherwise have to type.</p>

  <p>The AdjustSettings choice lets you load either the general or
  transfer configuration file into your default text editor, enabling
  you to make changes not possible through menus of DbDialog. No
  programming is required since DbDialog.ini and transfer.ini are
  standard .ini files. Making configuration changes in this way,
  however, is naturally more difficult, requiring an intermediate level
  of skill with the program.</p>

  <p>The Backup choice lets you copy the important database files
  DbDialog.mdb, DbDialog.ini, and transfer.ini to another folder. The
  Open choice lets you open a database from another folder. It works by
  referencing the DbDialog.ini file in that folder instead. This is
  temporary--the default location is restored the next time you run
  DbDialog.</p>

  <p>The Field Names and Sizes choice lets you review the structure of
  the current table by providing the name and size of all its fields.
  This information may be copied to the clipboard and used as the basis
  for creating a new table with some differences in structure. You can
  easily create a new table with the same structure, however, by
  choosing New Table and then Clone. You are prompted for the name of
  the new table, and then an empty one is created with the same
  structure. If you choose Define instead of Clone, you are provided
  with a template in a multi-line edit box. Revise the names and sizes
  of the input fields as you wish. You can have as many as 20 fields,
  but feel free to delete field definition lines if you want fewer. The
  last field may optionally use the word &quot;memo&quot; instead of a
  numeric size, thereby indicating a field for miscellaneous
  information of almost any size. Do not include spaces or punctuation
  symbols in the table and field names, except for an underscore symbol
  to connect words, e.g., First_Name.</p>

  <p>DbDialog automatically generates a label for each input field, and
  assumes that its initial character is to be used for direct access
  via the Alt modifier key. Other standard fields are automatically
  created: Tagged, ID, Created, and Modified. You can refine the table
  configuration later by editing the appropriate section of
  DbDialog.ini.</p>

  <p>The Import, Export, and Send choices let you transfer data from
  one table to another. You pick another table that will be the source
  for importing all its records, the target for exporting all records
  in the current filter, or the target for sending just the current
  record. By default, transfers occur only between fields with the same
  names. The transfer.ini file, however, allows you to configure a
  custom mapping between two tables. This advanced feature is probably
  best explained by examining the sample mapping between a table with
  the default Contact structure and a table with the structure used by
  a DOS-based database application I developed years ago called the
  Contact Tracking System (CTS). Note that a powerful feature of both
  the DbDialog.ini and transfer.ini files is the potential of using an
  alias for a table type. In this way, you can have multiple tables
  with the same structure by simply referring to the same alias.</p>

  <p>The Verbatim SQL choice is for advanced users familiar with the
  syntax of Structured Query Language (SQL). It prompts for an SQL
  command and passes it on literally to the underlying database driver.
  It might be used, for example, to issue an SQL &quot;Alter
  Table&quot; command to change the structure of an existing
  table--something not possible through DbDialog menus.<br>
  Configuring New Tables<br>
  As previously explained, you can define new tables via the Extra
  Tools menu. If you want more control over the table definition,
  however, you may use another program like Microsoft Access to define
  the table, and then configure it for DbDialog by adding a section to
  the DbDialog.ini file. Within Microsoft Access, the table definition
  process is generally accessible with a screen reader. Steps to do
  this are described as follows.</p>

  <p>In Microsoft Access, press Control+O to open the DbDialog.mdb
  database, located by default at<br>
  C:\Program Files\DbDialog\DbDialog.mdb<br>
  Choose the option to create a new table in design view. The first
  fiew fields should be defined as Tagged (text 1), Created (text 10),
  Modified (text 10), and ID (autonumber). Press F6 to toggle between
  the page for field name and type, and that for size and other
  attributes.</p>

  <p>The last field may have any name, but should have a type of memo.
  Up to 20 intervening fields may be defined with a type of text, and
  any name or size. Press Control+S to save the table structure, and
  give it the desired name when prompted.</p>

  <p>Now configure additional table settings in the DbDialog.ini file,
  located by default at<br>
  C:\Program Files\DbDialog\DbDialog.ini<br>
  Using any text editor, add a new section to the file based on that of
  an existing table, e.g., via copy and paste. Change settings for the
  new table, including the window title to use and various lists of
  fields, including input fields, field labels, status bar fields,
  select fields, and index fields. Once configured, the table may be
  picked with the Go To command.</p>

  <p>Advanced users may also create new tables by means of SQL. The
  CreateList attribute of a table section in DbDialog.ini contains the
  names and sizes of fields in the format required by the SQL
  &quot;Create Table&quot; command. If DbDialog cannot open a table
  picked with the Go To command, it asks whether to create the table in
  this way.</p>

  <p>If a ConnectString attribute is not specified, the program uses
  the default corresponding to the DbDialog.mdb database in Microsoft
  Access 2000 format. Sample connect strings for MySQL and Dbase III
  Plus are provided in disabled table sections, where semicolon (;)
  characters precede each line to mark them as comments. Other connect
  strings for the ADO or ODBC APIs may be found at<br>

  Miscellaneous Tips<br>
  When focus is in the region of action buttons, pressing the Alt
  modifier key is not actually necessary to invoke a button--the
  invocation letter can be pressed by itself. If focus is on the record
  list, however, pressing Alt is necessary because the list box
  processes keystrokes unless bypassed via the Alt modifier.</p>

  <p>Since the record list is a standard list box, it supports initial
  character navigation. To indicate tagged status, an asterisk or space
  is always the initial character of a record in the list, so pressing
  asterisk will move to the next tagged record, and Space will move to
  the next untagged one.</p>

  <p>When focus is in the record list, the region of input fields
  displays data for the current record in the list. The controls in the
  region are disabled, however, so they are not visited in the tab
  navigation sequence. You can press Alt+V to enter the region in VIEW
  mode. Although you are not blocked from typing into the fields, no
  data will be saved in this mode. If focus is in the record list, you
  can also enter VIEW mode by pressing Enter. Thus, pressing Enter
  toggles between the record list and VIEW mode.</p>

  <p>When focus is in the input fields, the action buttons are disabled
  except for ;Lookup and /Run, which operate on the basis of a field
  rather than record.</p>

  <p>A speech friendly feature of DbDialog&#39;s user interface is
  called &quot;command echo.&quot; Immediate verbal confirmation is
  given for any button chosen or list item picked. This helps to
  reinforce an understanding of the options available and actions
  underway. Command echo works with the most popular screen readers at
  present: JAWS, NVDA, and Window-Eyes.</p>

  this documentation in the default web browser.<br>
  Development Notes<br>
  For the technically curious, I developed DbDialog with the AutoIt
  programming language from<br>
  <a href="http://AutoItScript.com">http://AutoItScript.com</a><br>
  The manipulation of Microsoft Access tables is done via an API called
  ActiveX Data Objects (ADO). Most Windows installations already
  include ADO, but the latest, 2.8 version may also be freely
  downloaded from<br>
  <a href=
  "http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/mdac/downloads/default.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/mdac/downloads/default.aspx</a><br>

  From that web page, follow links to download the latest versions of
  two components: (1) MDAC 2.8 and (2) Jet 4.0. The Jet download is
  specific to your version of Windows.</p>

  <p>Located in the program folder, the complete source code for
  DbDialog is in the file DbDialog.au3. Also used is the file LbC.au3:
  the function library I developed called Layout by Code, which is
  Documented in the file LbC.txt. The open source code in both files is
  covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), detailed in
  the file License.txt.</p>

  <p>I welcome feedback, which will help DbDialog and LbC improve over
  time. The latest version of the package is available at<br>
